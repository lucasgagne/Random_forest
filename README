This project is an implementation of a random forest which I used to make predictions for a Kaggle competition. 
Which predicts whether an email is spam/ legitamite and whether or not someone survived the Titanic accident. 
1. decision_tree_starter.py has files for  the implementation of decision trees and random forest objects
2. process_spam_data.py and process_titanic_data.py both process the raw CSV data into workable pandas and NumPy data
3. performance_eval.py evaluates and visualizes accuracy to optimize the model
4. visualize_titanic_tree.py generates a visual representation of the tree in order to actually interpret the decisions the model makes.
